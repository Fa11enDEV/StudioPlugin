# Installation

• Download [Server Here](https://www.roblox.com) and [Roblox Plugin Here](https://www.roblox.com)  
• Next, extract the already installed [Server](https://www.roblox.com) to a new folder (Inside desktop recommended).  
• Run it!

*Additional steps for **MacOS** users*
1. Download the Mac server
2. Extract it using the archive utility from the App Store
3. [Open your terminal](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125) and type `chmod u+x ` and then drag the server file into your terminal, press enter and it will turn the server into an executable file.
4. Open the executable file! (If it cannot verify for malware go to settings > Privacy and Security, scroll down until you find the warning, and press open anyway)

*Additional optional steps for **Windows** users*
1. Locate the `startup.vbs` file
2. Press Win + R and open `shell:startup`
3. Drag `startup.vbs` into the folder that opens
4. Edit `startup.vbs` with notepad
5. Copy the path to the server exe file
6. Replace `PATH_TO_EXE` with said path, make sure there is only one set of quotation marks  
This will automatically start the server without opening a command window


You might have an issue with the antivirus incorrectly flagging it as a virus, click "keep" and if needed exclude the file from your antivirus.

_Note: The cmd window needs to be open in order for the plugin to work!_
